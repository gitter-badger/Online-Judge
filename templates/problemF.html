        <p style="font-size: 14px; margin-left: 15px">    As we know that Vinay went to the library to learn Algorithms, he took a book of String theory and started reading it.<br> The book confused him so much that he got a phobia towards palindromes. He used to act in a weird way on seeing a palindrome. <br>To cure him of this fatal disease, doctors from all over Hyderabad discussed his fear and decided to expose him to large number of palindromes. <br><br>To do this, they decided to play a game with Vinay. The rules of the game are as follows:<br><br>Vinay has to supply a string S. The doctors have to add or insert characters to the string to make it a palindrome. Characters can be inserted anywhere in the string.<br> The doctors took this game very lightly and just appended the reverse of S to the end of S, thus making it a palindrome. <br>For example, if S = <i>"fft"</i>, the doctors change the string to <i>"ffttff"</i> and if S = <i>"MVSR"</i>, doctors change the string to "MVSRRSVM". Nowadays, Vinay is cured of the disease (having been exposed to a large number of palindromes), but he still wants to continue the game by his rules. He now asks the doctors to insert the minimum number of characters needed to make S a palindrome. <br><br>Help the doctors accomplish this task.<br>For instance, if S = <i>"fft"</i>, the doctors should change the string to <i>"tfft"</i>, adding only 1 character.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Input:</b> <br>
            Each test case consists of one line, the string S. The length of S will be no more than 6100 characters, and S will contain no whitespace characters.
        <br><br>
        <b>Output:</b>
        <br>
        For each test case output one line containing a single integer denoting the minimum number of characters that must be inserted into S to make it a palindrome.</p>

        <b style="margin-left: 15px">Explanation:</b><br>
        <p style="font-size: 14px; margin-left: 15px">In the first saample testcase, as S = <i>"fft"</i>, the doctors should change the string to <i>"tfft"</i>, adding only 1 character. But in the second test case, we need to add atleast 3 characters to make it a palindrome.</p>
